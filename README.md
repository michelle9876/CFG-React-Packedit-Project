# PackedIt (created by team 'Have you tried restarting?')
###  

PakedIt is a React web application for travellers, like you, to create and store lists of the things you need to remember to pack for trips.  It is designed to help you plan what you need to remember for your trips with ease and simplicity.  You can create a list for an upcoming trip by adding items to individual categories. You can view your items, edit them and ticked them off once you've packed them.  If you make an error you can also delete an item. 

### Who created it:
This web application was created by Eilidh Quinn, Gracialine Ong, Laura Almond and BoGyeong Kim as part of our final project for our CodeFirstGirls Nanodgree (Spring 2022 Fullstack).
